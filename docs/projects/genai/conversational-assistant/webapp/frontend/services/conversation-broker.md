# Conversation Broker Service

This service is responsible for managing interaction between UI components and other services related to chat (and voice)
functionality.

!!! WARNING "Isolation of business logic"

    All interaction with voice and chat MUST come through this service. Logic related to all global interaction has been
    encapsulated into this service, so that UI components can focus on UI states and only UI related logic that responds
    to changes reflected in this service.

    This service should reflect the global state of events necessary for UI components.
