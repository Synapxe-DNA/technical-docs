# Extract Article Content from the JavaScript Columns for Programs and Program-Sub-Pages

## Overview

In response to the needs of the HealthHub Team, we have expanded our extraction process to include content from the JavaScript-based columns. These columns contain crucial article information found on the “programs” and “program-sub-pages” articles that are not in the HTML file. By parsing and extracting content from these sources, we ensure comprehensive coverage of the article data for downstream applications.

## Approach

To extract content from the JavaScript columns, we implemented a two-step process:

1. **JavaScript Parsing**: We extract and clean the HTML structure dynamically generated by JavaScript. This ensures that hidden content is included in the data pipeline.

2. **Content Extraction**: Once the JavaScript elements are parsed, we extract the relevant text, ensuring that the content retains its structure and meaning, much like the regular HTML extraction process.

For more details on the implementation and code, refer to the notebooks here: [`IQuit.ipynb`](https://github.com/Synapxe-DNA/healthhub-content-optimization/blob/main/content-optimization/notebooks/IQuit.ipynb) and [`vaccinate.ipynb`](https://github.com/Synapxe-DNA/healthhub-content-optimization/blob/main/content-optimization/notebooks/vaccinate.ipynb)
