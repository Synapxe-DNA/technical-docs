# Mongo Connector

Mongo Connector is a concrete class that implements all the abstract method of the Database Connector that is dedicated for intereactions with MongoDB

All necessary MongoDB queries are handled by this class. This class also handle parsing of inputs and outputs to match the corresponding `Pydantic` models.

---

## Overview

This Python file defines a MongoConnector class that extends a DbConnector base class, specifically tailored for interacting with a MongoDB database using asynchronous operations. It provides methods to connect to the database, initialize the Beanie ODM with specific document models, and perform CRUD operations on various entities such as articles, groups, jobs, and edges. The class includes functionality to create and retrieve articles, groups, and jobs (tasks related to articles), as well as to manage relationships between articles through edges. The connector also converts MongoDB documents into Python objects for easier manipulation within the application.

async def get_edges(article_ids: List[str]) -> List[Edge]
```

Parameters:

- article_ids (List[str]): List of article IDs to fetch edges for.

Returns: List of `Edge` between the specified articles.

### Generated Article Operations

- **create_generated_article**

```python
async def create_generated_article(generated_articles: List[GeneratedArticle]) -> List[str]
```

Parameters:

- generated_articles (List[GeneratedArticle]): List of `GeneratedArticle` to be inserted.

Returns: List of IDs for the inserted generated articles.

### Job Operations

- **create_job**

```python
async def async def create_job(
        self,
        group_id: str,
        remove_jobs: List[str],
        optimise_jobs: List[str],
        ignore_jobs: List[str],
        combine_jobs: List[str],
    ) -> str
```

Description: This function is triggered upon user submission to create a new job entry in the database.
It updates the associated group's job attribute to ensure that the group is linked to only the most recent job.

Parameters:

- group_id (str): ID of group that this job is created for
- remove_jobs (List[str]): List of article IDs to be marked as removed
- optimise_jobs (List[str]): List of article IDs to be marked as optimised
- ignore_jobs (List[str]): List of article IDs to be marked as ignored
- combine_jobs (List[str]): List of article IDs to be marked as combine

Returns: ID of newly create job

- **get_job**

```python
async def get_job(self, job_id: str) -> Job
```

Parameters:

- job_id (str): The ID of the job to retrieve.

Returns: The specified `Job`.

### Job Combine Operations

- **create_combine_job**

```python
async def create_combine_job(
    self,
    group_id: str,
    sub_group_name: str,
    article_ids: List[str],
    remarks: str = "",
    context: str = "",
) -> str
```

Parameters:

- group_id (str): ID of group that this combine job was created from
- sub_group_name (str): Name of subgroup
- article_ids (List[str]): List of article IDs to be added in this subgroup
- remarks (str): Remarks for the generated article from this job given by the user [Optional]
- context (str): Context given by the user to add on to the harmonisation process [Optional]

Returns: ID of newly create combine job

Note: Checks are implemented to check if a combine job with the same values are already present in the database. If so, the existing combine job ID is returned instead of creating a new one.

async def get_combine_job(self, job_combine_id) -> JobCombine
```

Parameters:

- job_combine_id (str): ID of the combine job to retrieve.
