# Introduction

The frontend was build with [Angular](https://angular.dev/overview) to accommodate for isolation of app logic by using [services](https://angular.dev/guide/ngmodules/singleton-services#providing-a-singleton-service) to abstract logic away from components. [Taiga UI](https://taiga-ui.dev/) was used as the component library.
